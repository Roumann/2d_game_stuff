# What is this?

This is a collection of small projects that I have made while learning about cool new stuff.

This repository is a collection of resources from my journey into game development.

This repo is WIP, so I will be adding more stuff as I discover new things to learn and experiment with.

My goal is to create a collection of small projects that each focus on a specific aspect of GameDev/DSA/Math.
While also using this as a way to improve my JavaScript & DSA skills.

These small projects wil be ranging from simple rendering or game mechanics to more complex stuff like AI, physics and math simulations.

Right now, I am focusing on 2D games built with Canvas/Javascript, but in the future I hope to expand this to 3D with three.js or even proper Game Engines like Unity.
