# 2D Map Editor (WIP)

This is a simple 2D map editor that I made while learning about 2D game development.

It uses a 160x160px tile set and using Canvas API it allow to select specific tiles and place them on the Canvas map.

## TODO
- [ ] Allow custom tile-set image upload
- [ ] Make the map bigger - (Scale the whole wrapper)
- [ ] Fix styling 
- [ ] Code cleanup
