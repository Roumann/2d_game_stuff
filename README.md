# What is this?

This is a collection of small projects that I have made while learning about cool new stuff.

I really enjoy finding new things to learn and experiment with, so this repo is a place where I can keep track of all my random projects.

I will be adding more stuff as I discover new things to learn and experiment with.

My goal is to create a collection of small projects that each focus on a specific thing I want to learn about.

Ranging from GameDev stuff to Math, AI, Physics, etc.

As of writing this, I am interested in 2d game dev and physics simulations. So most of the projects will be focused on that.

## Resources 

Here are some cool resources that I found while creating these projects:

- GameDev Resources
    - [Resource 1](https://github.com/Roumann/projects_stash)
        - Some text about the resource.

- Physics Resources
    - [Resource 1](https://github.com/Roumann/projects_stash)
